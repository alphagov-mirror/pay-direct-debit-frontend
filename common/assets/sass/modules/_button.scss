// Because we have JS validating on blur there is
// an edge case (PP-5533) where when clicking the
// submit button when youâ€˜re focused on a errored
// field causes the page to jump up and then the
// click event misses the button.
// So we can fix this by making the button invisibly
// bigger when it becomes active.
